      <h3 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1">Study In UAE:</h3>
      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> Education may not be the first thing that springs to mind when
        considering the United Arab Emirates, but in the past ten years, a significant change in education has drawn a
        large number of foreign students, particularly from India, thanks to the country's top-notch colleges and
        possible tax-free earnings after graduation. The location is the primary motivator for Indian students to seek
        for admission in the United Arab Emirates.</p>
      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-3"> The Institute of International Education reported that 13,370 of the
        77,469 international students enrolled in the United Arab Emirates in 2017 were from India. Among the other
        nations of origin of non-Emirati students in the United Arab Emirates are the Syrian Arab Republic, Jordan,
        Pakistan, and Oman.&nbsp;<br>
      </p>
      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-4"> The QS World University Rankings list the Middle Eastern nation as
        having the greatest universities in the Gulf. Situated at the eastern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, the nation
        is composed of seven emirates or states, including Abu Dhabi and Dubai, which have consistently aided in the
        rise of private educational institutions and student enrollment.</p>
      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-5"> Students' top stream selections are business and engineering.
        Particularly, computer science and accounting and finance are two of the most popular undergraduate disciplines
        in the UAE for Indian students. In postgraduate studies, mechanical engineering is the most popular option.
        Although there are several colleges in the United Arab Emirates that attract foreign students, around 22% of
        Rochester Institute of Technology's student body is made up of Indian nationals. In addition, around 25% of the
        students at the University of Birmingham's UAE campus are from India.</p>
