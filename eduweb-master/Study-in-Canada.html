      <h4 class="u-text u-text-2">Degree Offered In Canada</h4>
      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-3"> Canada offers a diverse range of degree programs at various levels of
        study, catering to a wide array of academic and professional interests. Here are the main types of degrees
        offered in Canada:</p>
      <h4 class="u-align-left u-text u-text-4">Undergraduate Degrees In Canada</h4>
      <p class="u-text u-text-5"> Students who have completed the secondary school program are eligible to enrol in the
        different undergraduate degree programmes offered in Canada. Only accredited universities in Canada are
        permitted to award various bachelor's degrees to both international and domestic students. The length of an
        undergraduate degree programme in Canada is usually between 3 to 4 or years, depending on the university and
        whether the course is general or specialized. However, a few bachelor’s degree programmes can be completed
        within 2 years.<br>
        <br>&nbsp;Commonly, the top universities in Canada offer bachelor’s degree programmes as four-year courses which
        is a preferred choice among international students. Moreover, the four-year bachelor’s degree programmes are
        divided into 120 credits that all students need to complete in order to receive their degree.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>For those looking to get a PR in Canada, a 4-year bachelor's degree is a necessary criterion that all
        applicants need to meet. Additionally, an undergraduate degree earned in Canada is known to be comprehensive and
        valuable for students.
      </p>
      <h4 class="u-text u-text-6">Graduate Degrees In Canada</h4>
      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-7"> Graduate or Master's courses in Canada are some of the highly demanded
        higher education programmes among international students. Universities across Canada offer a range of graduate
        courses that attract thousands of international students from different corners of the world, as a result of the
        variety of opportunities available to students and graduates of a Canadian master's programme.<br>
        <br>&nbsp;Interested international students can apply for a Master’s degree programme in Canada with a valid
        Bachelor’s degree. The duration of the Master’s degree programme in Canada depends on the course and college
        chosen. Usually, it lasts between 18 months to 2 years, depending on the course and the university offering the
        programme. Generally, an MS course in Canada can be completed in 2 years, while some other courses like MBA, and
        MBA Executive in Canada can be completed within 1 year.
      </p>
      <blockquote class="u-text u-text-default u-text-8"> Note: International students must be enrolled in a Designated
        Learning Institution to pursue higher studies in Canada, be it for undergraduate or postgraduate studies. A
        Canadian study visa is approved only if the student has an approved offer letter from DLI. A DLI is an
        educational institution in Canada approved by the Government of a specific province or territory in Canada to
        host international students.</blockquote>

        Activities</h4>
      <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> Student life on-campus and off-campus in Canada is varied
        and exciting, especially for international students who are looking to experience Canadian culture. From
        extra-curricular activities on-campus in Canadian universities to experience the varied cultures across Canada
        and the thousands of tourist and undiscovered spots that are waiting to be explored.<br>
        <br>&nbsp;On-campus, universities and colleges in Canada offer a variety of opportunities for students, ranging
        from participating in extracurricular activities and sports to joining a number of academic and non-academic
        clubs and groups, students can enjoy taking part in the things that they love. Through all this, students can
        use the opportunity to branch out and socialise with different students, learn and experience new cultures,
        food, activities and other experiences.<br>
        <br>&nbsp;However, to truly enjoy life as a student in a foreign country, is to take a trip through the country
        they are living in, and enjoy the neighbouring communities, towns and cities. In the surrounding cities, towns
        and communities in Canada, wherever a university or college is situated, students will be able to experience
        varied cultures. Exploring the various attractions in the neighbouring places can be a good way to take a break
        from studying.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>The experience of studying in Canada will be different to every other country as Canada is one of the top
        destinations for students, skilled migrants and people from all over the world. This has attracted millions of
        people from different countries, many bringing their cultures and traditions, which students can experience
        during their study abroad adventure in Canada.<br>
        <br>&nbsp;One of the few attractions includes the varied foods available in Canada. While the stereotype of
        poutine and maple syrup may seem true, the French and British influence on the foods available in Canada has
        been immense.

      <h3 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1"> Job Opportunities For International Students In Canada</h3>
      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> One benefit of having a student visa in Canada is that it allows you to
        stay in the country for up to three years after graduation and permits you to work part-time. According to
        several reports, Canada has experienced a surge in the number of international students from around the globe in
        recent years, and it has also given working professionals and students alike access to a wide range of job
        prospects. International students will therefore have a wide range of employment opportunities during their
        studies and following graduation. Higher-paying positions are also available to international students. </p>
      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-3"> In addition, the Canadian government has made it possible for foreign
        students to work 20 hours a week while they are enrolled in classes. Additionally, jobs can be found both on and
        off campus, and if you're a foreign student, your study permission must verify that you are allowed to work.</p>
      <h4 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-4"> On-Campus Jobs in Canada </h4>
      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-5"> Students can work without a work permit for their university/college, a
        faculty member, their own business, or a student organisation in this type of job. However, as post-secondary
        international students, they can only work if they have:</p>
      <ul class="u-text u-text-default u-text-6">
        <li> A full-time post secondary student enrolled in a Designated Learning Institution (DLI)</li>
        <li>&nbsp;A current study permission</li>
        <li>&nbsp;A Social Security Number</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-7"> Off-Campus Jobs in Canada</h4>
      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-8"> Students are permitted to work outside of school in such a position.
        Students can look for different types of part-time jobs like being a tutor, waiters, or any other temporary
        positions, but remember that they can only work when they have:</p>
      <ul class="u-text u-text-default u-text-9">
        <li> A valid study permit indicating that they are permitted to work off-campus</li>
        <li>Enrolling in a DLI (Designated Learning Institute), A 6-month programme leading to a degree, certificate, or
          diploma.</li>
