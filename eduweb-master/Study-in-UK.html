      <h4 class="u-custom-font u-font-merriweather u-text u-text-default u-text-1"> Why study in the UK:</h4>

        education in the UK, providing an opportunity to interact with people from all backgrounds, learn about their

      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-3">
        <span style="font-weight: 700;"> Cost-Effective and World-Class Education</span>: Academic excellence offered by
        UK universities has a long-standing reputation that can be traced back to the 11th century. Even today, there
        are over 160 universities and institutions in the country, of which 84 are featured in the 2021 QS World
        University Rankings. Degrees from these universities are valued across the world, which work best in the future,
        no matter which industry or location. <br> International students in the UK enjoy financial benefits and given
        that the duration of a UK degree is less compared to other countries, studying in the country in any way becomes
        affordable. Besides that, the country is well known for offering numerous scholarships, grants and bursaries to

        skills, earning money while studying and preparing themselves for the professional world. <br>
        <br> The UK government has recently announced a post-study visa or Graduate Route, allowing international
        students graduating from Summer 2021 to stay and work in the UK for the next two years. <br>

        where university campuses value diversity and different food, traditions and cultures and interests. This
        further leads to unique and new student experiences almost every day. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Affordable Cost of Living</span>: Although this is primarily dependent on the
        location and the area one will be shifting to, in general, the UK boasts decent living standards at affordable
        prices. Cities such as London, Brighton and Oxford could be a little pricey, but affordable cities such as
        Aberdeen, Newcastle and Manchester offer high quality of education and lifestyle. <br>
        <br>Healthcare in the UK is usually free of charge for international students and they can also make the most of
        student discounts offered on travel, shopping and food to save money. <br>
        <br>

      <h4 class="u-custom-font u-font-merriweather u-text u-text-default u-text-1"> Education System in the UK</h4>
      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> The primary, secondary, university preparation, further education, and
        higher education sectors make up the UK's educational system. Students in the UK are legally required to attend
        primary and secondary school from the age of 5 until the age of 16. Based on age groupings or five "key stages,"
        this can be further broken down, according the UK's 1988 National Curriculum:</p>
      <ul class="u-text u-text-default u-text-3">
        <li> Key Stage 1: Foundation year and years 1 and 2: for those aged between 5 and 7 years old&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Key Stage 2: Years 3 to 6: for those aged between 8 and 11 years old</li>
        <li>&nbsp;Key Stage 3: Years 7 to 9: for those aged between 12 and 14 years old&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Key Stage 4: Years 10 to 11: for those aged between 15 and 16 years old&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Key Stage 5: Years 12 to 13: for those aged between 17 and 18 years old</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="u-text u-text-4">Primary Education</h4>
      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-5"> Some primary schools can be divided into infant and junior levels,
        which start from the age of five and continue until the age of 11. While the infant level is for those aged
        between 5 and , the junior level is for children between the ages of 7 and 11.</p>
      <h4 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-6">Secondary Education</h4>
      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-7"> Secondary education includes the key stage 3 - years 7 and 9, for those
        aged between 15 and 16 years old and also the key stage 4 - years 10 and 11, for those aged between 15 and 16
        years old. The UK school system, here, requires students to study subjects such as Math, English, Science,
        Humanity and a Modern Language along with optional subjects like Art, Music, a Regional Language, Physical
        Education, Computer Science, Design Technology.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>The key stage 3 can be further divided into junior and senior school- the former from year 7 to year 8 and
        the latter from year 8 to year 9. Year 9 is considered quite important under the British school system given
        that most students here make the transition from junior to senior school.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>In the last two years of secondary education in the UK, students prepare for the General Certificate of
        Secondary Education (GCSE) examinations which are taken after two years. Here, students study compulsory
        subjects such as English, Math, 2/3 Sciences, History/Geography, Modern Language etc along with other 9 and 12
        subjects.
      </p>
      <h4 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-8">University Preperation</h4>
      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-9"> In the UK education system, after secondary education, students can
        start a two-year program which leads to Advanced level examinations. University preparation falls under years 12
        and 13, when students specialise in three to four subjects relevant to the subject they wish to study at
        university level.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>Those who would want to study over three to four subjects can continue into more subjects with the
        International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme offered by independent schools.
