      <h3 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1">Study In Australia:</h3>
      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> Australia has emerged as one of the world's leading educational
        powerhouses, serving over 8,00000 international students annually. India, China, Nepal, Brazil, and Vietnam
        account for the majority of the international student population in Australia. These five nations account for
        more than half of the foreign student body. Students in Australia's educational institutions have access to
        cutting-edge knowledge and innovation as well as top-notch study techniques. After the US and the UK, Australia
        has the third-highest intake of international students.</p>
      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-3"> One noteworthy and unexpected fact about Australia is that about 2.5
        million foreign students who studied or pursued higher education there now hold positions in prestigious
        institutions, businesses, and organizations all around the nation. Aside from these benefits, there are many
        more to studying in Australia, including employment chances during your studies, acknowledgment for your degree
        internationally, and serene, lovely surroundings.</p>

      <h3 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1">Why study in Australia?</h3>
      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> International students choose Australia because of its excellent level
        of life, flexible education system, and large selection of major and minor disciplines. The following is a
        summary of some of the main arguments in favor of requiring students to study in Australia.</p>
      <ol class="u-text u-text-default u-text-3">
        <li>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;"> High-Quality Education</span>: Over the years, Australia has emerged as the
          third most popular destination in the world for international students. Among the English-speaking countries,
          Australia is one of the best options for international students who are looking for high-quality education at
          affordable prices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">&nbsp;International Recognition</span>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">: </span>The degrees awarded by Australian universities have international
          recognition and high value in the job market. Australian universities have a good reputation across the world,
          and students graduating from these universities have good chances of securing jobs in any part of the world.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">&nbsp;Cost of Living</span>: Living expenses and tuition fee are low in
          Australia as compared to many other top nations proffering education to international students. Students
          pursuing higher studies in Australian universities can take up part-time jobs to cover their living expenses.
          International students pursuing higher studies in Australia may also apply for scholarships.
        </li>
        <li>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">Diversity of Education: </span>Australian universities offer a wide
          range of courses and degrees. Therefore, it is flexible for international students to choose a course or
          degree as per their interest and career aspirations. Also, international students in Australian universities
          have the flexibility to switch between qualification levels and from one educational institution to another.
        </li>
        <li>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">Scope for Scientific Research: </span>Students in Australian
          universities have a greater scope to take up scientific research. The universities in Australia give more
          emphasis to innovation, scientific research and technology. On the other hand, Australia comprises impressive
          technological resources, which students can access for their educational needs.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Flexibility to Take Up Part-Time Jobs:</span> International students pursuing
          higher education in Australian universities have the freedom or flexibility to take up part-time jobs so that
          they can cover their living expenses.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-4"> Over the past five years, foreign student enrollment at Australian
        universities has increased by almost 54%. The majority of this increase, according to an Australian news
        broadcast website, has occurred in the non-award sectors, English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas
        Students (ELICOS), and Vocational Education and Training (VET) schools. According to data from the Australian
        Bureau of Statistics, the value of overseas education increased by 22% from $28.1 billion in 2016 to $32.4
        billion in 2018.</p>
      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-5"> In Australia, there are two primary regulations that support
        high-quality education for overseas students. The National Code of Practice and the Education Services for
        Overseas Students (ESOS) Act of 2000 are these. This upholds Australia's standards as a nation and as a pioneer
        in the provision of education worldwide.</p>

      <h4 class="u-text u-text-1">Education System In Australia</h4>
      <h4 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2">Vocational Education</h4>
      <p class="u-text u-text-3"> The Australian higher education system begins with the vocational education system.
        Technical and Further Education (TAFE) is the name of the vocational education system in Australia. The
        government provides direct funding for Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institutions, which grant
        certificates, diplomas, and advanced diplomas. TAFEs also grant bachelor's degrees in several programs. </p>
      <h4 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-4"> Bachelorâ€™s Degree&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      </h4>
      <p class="u-text u-text-5"> In Australia, there are about 37 public institutions that receive funding from the
        Commonwealth for higher education.<br>
        <br>In Australia, bachelor's degree programs typically last three years, though applicants may elect to continue
        for a fourth year, known as "Honours," if they so choose. However, in order to receive their degree, students
        enrolled in honors courses must prepare and turn in a thesis. An honors qualification is given to candidates who
        successfully finish an honors course as part of their degree. For instance, honors courses in chemistry,
        zoology, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        <br>In Australia, students pursuing a bachelor's degree have the opportunity to select "Minor" courses in a
        particular topic in addition to their major courses. Minors are considered to be specializations within a
        certain academic field, and typically consist of fewer courses than majors.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>Some Australian universities allow students to pursue double degrees. Students taking up double degree
        courses are required to complete major courses in two fields of study.&nbsp;<br>
      </p>
      <h4 class="u-text u-text-6">Master's Degree</h4>
      <p class="u-text u-text-7"> When it comes to Master's courses, the duration/length of the course is of two years
        atin most in Australian universities. The best universities to pursue masterâ€™s courses in Australia are included
        among the best international universities, such as Australian National University, UNSW Sydney, The University
        of Queensland, University of Melbourne, and University of Wollongong. <br>
        <br>The most popular masterâ€™s courses to apply for in Australia are STEM, business and management, economics,
        architecture, etc. The majority of regional universities in Australia offer taught and research based masterâ€™s
        courses. The natural resource enrichment of the country is most pivotal in its role of offering honours and
        research based courses in the relevant fields and streams.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      </p>
      <h4 class="u-text u-text-8"> Examination System </h4>
      <p class="u-text u-text-9"> Australian universities conduct one or two exams per term, and the final assessment of
        students is done on the basis of performance in these exams. Certain courses in Australian universities require
        laboratory work/language classes, and these courses place more emphasis on attendance, assignments and
        participation. <br>
        <br>Student participation/involvement is one of the major components of the Australian education system. At
        universities, students are encouraged to express opinions, ask questions and speak up in lectures. The
        examination system of Australian universities places more emphasis on the critical thinking of students rather
        than the mere memorisation of subjects/topics/lectures.

      <h4 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1">Admission process Of Australian Universities</h4>
      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> The admissions process, which differs throughout universities, is an
        internal administrative concern. There are, nevertheless, a lot of elements that apply to all admissions
        procedures. The existence of a common education system is the primary cause. Although specific dates, deadlines,
        qualifications, costs, available courses, and class sizes may vary, there is a general timetable or procedure
        that may be understood.</p>
      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-3"> Step 1: <br> Shortlisting Universities Students need to check out the
        fee schedule and eligibility criteria of the Australian universities offering their desired programmes. On the
        basis of their research work, they need to shortlist the universities which are most compatible with their own
        goals. <br>
        <br>Step 2: <br>Attempting Study Abroad Tests After shortlisting the universities, students need to prepare,
        register, and attempt the study abroad entrance exams. These exams shall be mentioned in the eligibility
        criteria of the university. <br>
        <br> Step 3: <br>Compiling Application Documents Once the results have been declared of the entrance exams then
        students need to compile the application documents for their shortlisted universities. The document requirements
        may differ for different universities and the collateral processes may also be extensive. It is strongly
        recommended that students start preparing the application documents on a tentative basis and well before
        applications start being accepted. <br>
        <br>Step 4: <br> Applying before Deadlines Once the universities declare the admission dates and deadlines for
        the applications, students need to submit their applications to their respective universities. It is beneficial
        to apply early in the admissions season to ensure proper attention and less competition. <br>
        <br>Step 5: Await Decision and Prepare Student Visa Application Documents <br>After applying for the documents
        and gaining confirmation of application from the respective universities students need to await the Offer Letter
        of Acceptance. While waiting for the offer letter they can start preparing the documents required for the
        Australian Student Visa application.

      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> Australian universities are now accepting applications for two intakes
        of students:<br>&nbsp;February and July. During these intakes, both native and international students may apply
        for admission to Australian universities. Students can apply for a variety of programs throughout both intakes,
        including business and management courses, STEM courses, master's degrees, and doctoral degrees.
      </p>
      <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-default u-text-3"> Each intake season has its own deadlines and international
        students are strongly encouraged to apply well in advance once the admissions have been declared as ongoing.
        While a tentative guideline can be ascertained for each intake, varying universities have different deadlines
        for their admission processes.</p>
      <p class="u-text u-text-4"> Every intake season shall carry the following characteristics for international
        students:</p>
      <ul class="u-text u-text-5">
        <li> Both the intakes are considered as main admission seasons in Australia and students can apply for various
          qualifications and streams.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;Students may find that certain masterâ€™s and doctoral courses are not available for application along
          with other courses. Such programmes admission window is either quite short or slated to lie in the later legs
          of the intake season.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;A sub-intake season is also available for international students to apply for admission to Australian
          universities. The November intake season is open for only certain courses.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;In case the desired course is slated for the admissions process in the November intake, then
          international students are advised to avoid the high competition rate of the main intakes.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;International students need to start preparing for their admission intakes at least seven to eight
          months before the intake is slated to begin.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;In order to ensure that early application can be made, students need to be well prepared with their
          entrance exam scores, language proficiency scores, academic transcripts, LORs, SOP, etc.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;In case of multiple admission applications, students are strongly advised to direct their applications
          specifically to the varying universities rather than applying through a single application.</li>

      <h4 class="u-text u-text-1">Scholarships For International students</h4>
      <p class="u-text u-text-2"> According to estimates, studying abroad in Australia will cost at least two or three
        times as much overall as studying in India. Students will inevitably think about the possibilities that can
        drastically lessen their financial burden as a result of this. Scholarships are the option that students
        prioritize even if college loans and waivers are frequently selected. The primary cause is the long-term
        elimination of financial strain.</p>
      <p class="u-text u-text-3"> Scholarships remove the future repayment load in addition to enabling students to
        complete their higher education in Australia without financial constraints. Depending on their eligibility,
        international students can apply for a variety of scholarships in Australia. Every scholarship has its own set
        of guidelines, requirements for eligibility, restricted recipients, terms for the future, and components or
        amount of the prize. Certain scholarships specify the costs they will pay for and how much of them, while others
        have a set amount. In a similar vein, several kinds of scholarshipsâ€”such as need- and merit-based
        scholarshipsâ€”are also offered depending on the requirements for qualifying. Scholarship programs can be divided
        into two categories in addition to eligibility: government, university, or trust fund awarding organizations.
      </p>
      <blockquote class="u-text u-text-4"> Students need to apply for scholarships after they have been accepted by the
        universities for their applied courses. The overall process of applying to the scholarships for international
        students in Australia can be serialsed as follows:</blockquote>
      <p class="u-text u-text-5">
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Step 1:</span> On receiving the confirmation letter of enrollment, students need
        to explore the scholarship programmes available for them to pursue their chosen course programme at the
        university.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: 700;">Step 2: </span>They have to further shortlist the scholarship programmes whose
        eligibility criteria they manage to satisfy.<br>
        <br>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">Step 3:</span> They then have to compile their documents according to
        the eligibility criteria of the shortlisted scholarship programmes and apply for the respective programmes
        before their deadlines.<br>
        <br>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">Step 4</span>: Await the final decision of the selection committee.
      </p>
      <p class="u-text u-text-6"> The students are hereby informed that the eligibility criteria and conditions of the
        scholarship programmes do not cease on granting of the award. In the majority of cases, students need to
        continuously satisfy the eligibility criteria until they are benefitting as an awardee of the respective
        programme. In fact, many merit scholarships mention the minimum aggregate that the beneficiary students need to
        maintain to continue getting the award.</p>

        Australia not only for the high-quality education it offers but also for the unique cultural experience that it

        people from all over the world every semester. <br>
        <br> Living on-campus means students are closer to the academic buildings, classes and social clubs and
        organisations. No matter how large or small the university is, all schools and universities in Australia will
        have several student organisations, ranging from small study groups to specialised activity clubs for activities
        such as surfing, cycling, rowing, drama, and many more. <br>
        <br>As one nears graduation, they may realise how learning outside of the classroom has had a key role to play
        in their student life experience in Australia. In addition, although not many know, sports in Australia is
        booming like never before. Universities in the country have exclusive organisations that let students
        participate in sports like cricket, boxing, football, fencing, archery, among others. They focus on wellbeing,
        health and athletic excellence, paving the way for a holistic campus experience.

          <span style="font-weight: 700;">&nbsp;Full-time Jobs</span>: The graduates who complete their higher education
          from Australian universities need to apply for Post Study Work Visa to be able to work on a full-time basis.
          Alternatively, international job seekers require a Work Permit of Australia to work in Australia as a
          full-time employee.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="u-custom-font u-font-merriweather u-text u-text-default u-text-3"> In addition to employment prospects,
        overseas students and graduates employed in Australia are subject to the many national rules and regulations of
        the country. This includes the National Minimum Wage, which establishes the minimum pay to which any individual
        with the ability to work must be entitled in exchange for their services to an employer. Australia's minimum
        wage is currently $14.54 USD, or roughly AUD 21.41. This minimal hourly pay is a right that all international
        students have in exchange for their services. </p>
      <p class="u-custom-font u-font-merriweather u-text u-text-default u-text-4"> The regulations concerning the
        minimum and sustainable income for international students in Australia also extend to the realm of income and
        wealth taxation. In other words, if international students earn an income from their part-time employment that,
        after considering deductions and exemptions, falls within the taxable brackets outlined by the Australian income
        tax slab rates, they are required to fulfill their tax obligations. Similarly, if students accumulate a net
        worth and assets that are subject to Australian wealth tax, they must contribute the applicable direct tax to
        the country's economy. These stipulations are governed by Australian land and territorial laws, meaning that the
        income source and asset location must be within the boundaries of Australia for them to be subjected to taxation
        by the Australian government.<br>
      </p>
      <blockquote class="u-text u-text-default u-text-5"> International students can approach their respective
        university administrations to understand better the working and earning facilities in Australia from which they
        can benefit.</blockquote>
