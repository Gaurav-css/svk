        students in Germany includes PhDs. under a Doctoral programme, applicants will be asked to write a research
        paper on any specific subject under their respective fields.<br>

        style Doctoral programme where you will work on your dissertation alone and will be supervised by a faculty
        member from the university you choose. Here, you will be required to find a supervisor for your PhD studies
        beforehand. Another option allows you to pursue your doctorate studies under several supervisors during a fixed
        period of 3 years.

      <h3 class="u-align-left u-text u-text-default u-text-4">Why Study in Germany?</h3>
      <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-default u-text-5"> Studying in Germany is a popular choice for international
        students due to several compelling reasons:</p>
      <ul class="u-align-left u-text u-text-6">
        <li>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;"> Minimal or No Tuition Fees:</span> Most State-run or public universities in
          Germany offer education to students free of charge, practically. Apart from a few administrative charges,
          students do not have to pay any tuition fees. However, Private universities may charge their students a
          tuition fee according to the degree, even so, tuition fees charged are comparatively cheaper than in most
          other EU states.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Variety of Options:</span> German Higher education institutions offer
          international students a variety of options in terms of the degrees and courses available. Most of the courses
          offered by the institutions are taught in English, therefore, international students need not be proficient in
          the German language.
        </li>
        <li>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">Globally-Recognised Programmes:</span> Studying a programme offered by
          a German Higher Education Institution is recognised by Universities and Organisations across the world.
          Therefore, graduating from a German institution will help your future prospects in your respective fields.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">&nbsp;Comparatively Inexpensive Living:</span> Among the many EU states, the
          cost of living in Germany is comparatively inexpensive. With amenities such as public transport, shared
          accommodation and much more, Germany becomes an affordable option for international students.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">&nbsp;Globally Ranked Universities:</span> Germany is one of the top countries
          with Universities that are highly ranked in some of the top-ranking institutions. 10 Universities in the
          country are ranked within the top 200 universities in the world by the QS Rankings. Institutions such as
          Technische Universitat Munchen, Humboldt University of Berlin, Freie Universitat Berlin and more.

      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> Germany attracts international students from all across the world due
        to several reasons including excellence in research and teaching, job opportunities, safe and economically
        stable location, close links between theory and practice, beautiful landscape, a wide range of courses as well
        as a great campus life experience. German universities have a multicultural environment where an international
        student is likely to meet mates of several nationalities including Portuguese, French, Lithuanian, Turkish, and
        many more.<br>
        <br>&nbsp;While many may believe language could be a barrier at German universities, professors do speak fluent
        English and have advanced proficiency in the language. In general, as well, most German people will be able to
        interact with you in English although not fluently.<br>
        <br>Universities in Germany focus on going beyond classroom learning and organising several events where
        students are encouraged to join clubs, engage in sports and attend student parties.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>Playing sports in Germany means a number of classes based on any sport that one may be interested in. These
        may include sports such as fencing, soccer, argentine tango, yoga, swimming, basketball as well as ultimate
        frisbee, pole dance and bouldering that are not really popular in the country.<br>
        <br>&nbsp;Extracurricular activities play a huge role in Germanyâ€™s university culture. Students can participate
        in a wide range of groups that are closely associated with not only academic subjects but also political
        parties, music, athletics, theatre, foreign languages and more.

      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> Get in touch with the German embassy or consulate in your native
        country to start the visa application process for studying in Germany. Additionally, if a German academic
        institution has accepted you, you can start the application process for a student visa with your admissions
        letter or entrance exam results (as specified by the school of your choice). If you don't have either of these
        documents, you can apply for a prospective student visa.&nbsp;<br>
      </p>
      <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-3"> The three-month validity of the student visa can be extended for an
        additional six months if you are accepted into a school, enroll in a foundation course, or sign up for any kind
        of preparatory German language program within that time frame. It is also advised that you start the visa
        application process as soon as possible. Once you have spent some time in the nation with the prospective
        student visa, you may apply for a residence permit to study.</p>
